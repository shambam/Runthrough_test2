  abstract = "Learning to programme requires complex cognitive skills that
              computing students find it arduous in comprehension. PP (pair
              programming) is an intensive style of programme cooperation where
              two people working together in resolving programming scenarios.
              It begins to draw the interests of educators as a teaching
              approach to facilitate learning and improve programming
              performance. The approach of PP, its model, benefits and
              limitations as well as the LS (learning style) preference are
              presented in the first part of this paper. The research findings
              and discussion on the application of PP involving 96 first year
              computing students are incorporated in the second part of this
              paper. The participants in these two intact classes were randomly
              assigned either to the experimental group that received PP or to
              the control group that received DI (direct instruction) method
              only. In PP group, students worked in pairs based on the
              visual-verbal LS dimension and those of DI group work
              individually. During a seven-week treatment, both groups applied
              program flowcharts and pseudocode in solving programming tasks.
              This study used two assessment methods--the formative and
              summative to examine the students' programming achievements. Two
              programming assignments were used as a formative assessment tool,
              also the CPPT (computer programming performance test) as the
              second tool which comprises of a pre-test, an immediate post-test
              and a delayed post-test, was administrated to assess the
              students' programming recall and retention. The result findings
              indicated that students in PP group significantly outperformed
              those in DI group for both the formative and summative
              assessments. However, only the visual and verbal students
              performed significantly better in recall than the retention. The
              analysis on the interaction effects revealed that learning is
              within inner self with regard to the instructional strategies
              applied and LS preference in classroom environment. In this case,
              the effectiveness of instructional strategies adopted to foster
              learning somehow depends on the type of learners. Therefore,
              educators should reflect on individual learning abilities while
              applying PP to stimulate students' engagement and critical
              thinking skills that subsequently will have positive influence on
              academic performance. (Contains 4 figures and 3 tables.)",

               and student perceptions on the viability of pair rotation.
               Teachers find pair rotation valuable because the teaching staff
               can obtain multiple peer evaluations on each student and because
               dysfunctional pairs are regularly disbanded. However, pair
               rotation adds to the burden of assigning pairs multiple times
               per semester. The majority of students in the study perceived
               pair rotation to be a desirable approach. Additionally, most
               students considered peer evaluation to be an effective means of
               providing feedback to teaching staff. However, they did not

              improve the ability of researchers to study the complexity of
              cell architecture. Confocal microscopes take pictures of
              fluorescently labeled proteins or molecules at different focal
              planes to create a stack of two-dimensional images throughout the
              specimen. Current software applications reconstruct the
              three-dimensional (3D) image and render it as a two-dimensional
              projection onto a computer screen where users need to rotate the
              image to expose the full 3D structure. This process is mentally
              taxing, breaks down if you stop the rotation, and does not take
              advantage of the eye's full field of view. ConfocalVR exploits
              consumer-grade VR systems to fully immerse the user in the 3D
              cellular image. In this virtual environment, the user can (1)
              adjust image viewing parameters without leaving the virtual
              space, (2) reach out and grab the image to quickly rotate and
              scale the image to focus on key features, and (3) interact with
              other users in a shared virtual space enabling real-time
              collaborative exploration and discussion. We found that immersive
              VR technology allows the user to rapidly understand cellular

  abstract = "Background: Confocal microscopes deliver detailed
              three-dimensional data and are instrumental in biological
              analysis and research. Usually, this three-dimensional data is
              rendered as a projection onto a two-dimensional display. We
              describe a system for rendering such data using a modern virtual
              reality (VR) headset. Sample manipulation is possible by
              fully-immersive hand-tracking and also by means of a conventional
              gamepad. We apply this system to the specific task of
              colocalization analysis, an important analysis tool in biological
              microscopy. We evaluate our system by means of a set of user
              trials. Results: The user trials show that, despite inaccuracies
              which still plague the hand tracking, this is the most productive
              and intuitive interface. The inaccuracies nevertheless lead to a
              perception among users that productivity is low, resulting in a
              subjective preference for the gamepad. Fully-immersive
              manipulation was shown to be particularly effective when defining
              a region of interest (ROI) for colocalization analysis.
              Conclusions: Virtual reality offers an attractive and powerful
              means of visualization for microscopy data. Fully immersive
              interfaces using hand tracking show the highest levels of
              intuitiveness and consequent productivity. However, current

              visual space. Whenever the goal is to preserve similarity
              relations a frequent strategy is to use 2D projections, which
              afford intuitive interactive exploration, e.g., by users locating
              and selecting groups and gradually drilling down to individual
              objects. In this paper, we propose a framework for projecting
              high-dimensional data to 3D visual spaces, based on a
              generalization of the Least- Square Projection (LSP). We compare
              projections to 2D and 3D visual spaces both quantitatively and
              through a user study considering certain exploration tasks. The
              quantitative analysis confirms that 3D projections outperform 2D
              projections in terms of precision. The user study indicates that
              certain tasks can be more reliably and confidently answered with
              3D projections. Nonetheless, as 3D projections are displayed on
              2D screens, interaction is more difficult. Therefore, we
              incorporate suitable interaction functionalities into a framework
              that supports 3D transformations, predefined optimal 2D views,
              coordinated 2D and 3D views, and hierarchical 3D cluster
              definition and exploration. For visually encoding data clusters
              in a 3D setup, we employ color coding of projected data points as
              well as four types of surface renderings. A second user study
              evaluates the suitability of these visual encodings. Several
              examples illustrate the framework's applicability for both visual
              exploration of multidimensional abstract (non-spatial) data as

               hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to
               be supplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct
               interpretation of maps.In this paper, we describe a new method,
               called MING, for ``Map Interpretation using Neighbourhood
               Graphs''. It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of map
               quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the
               distortions. This is done by displaying on the map the nearest
               neighbours graphs computed in the data space and in the
               embedding. Shared and unshared edges exhibit reliable and
               unreliable neighbourhood information conveyed by the mapping. By
               this mean, analysts may determine whether proximity (or
               remoteness) of points on the map faithfully represents
               similarity (or dissimilarity) of original data, within the
               meaning of a chosen map quality criteria. We apply this approach
               to two pairs of widespread indicators: precision/recall and
               trustworthiness/continuity, chosen for their wide use in the
               community, which will allow an easy handling by users.",

              critical for visualization, exploration, and interpretation of
              high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, as they enable
              the extraction of major trends in the data while discarding
              noise. However, biological data contains a type of predominant
              structure that is not preserved in commonly used methods such as
              PCA and tSNE, namely, branching progression structure. This
              structure, which is often non-linear, arises from underlying
              biological processes such as differentiation, graded responses to
              stimuli, and population drift, which generate cellular (or
              population) diversity. We propose a novel, affinity-preserving
              embedding called PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for
              Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding), designed explicitly to
              preserve progression structure in data. PHATE provides a
              denoised, two or three-dimensional visualization of the complete
              branching trajectory structure in high-dimensional data. It uses
              heat-diffusion processes, which naturally denoise the data, to
              compute cell-cell affinities. Then, PHATE creates a
              diffusion-potential geometry by free-energy potentials of these
              processes. This geometry captures high-dimensional trajectory
              structures, while enabling a natural embedding of the intrinsic
              data geometry. This embedding accurately visualizes trajectories
              and data distances, without requiring strict assumptions
              typically used by path-finding and tree-fitting algorithms, which
              have recently been used for pseudotime orderings or
              tree-renderings of cellular data. Furthermore, PHATE supports a
              wide range of data exploration tasks by providing interpretable
              overlays on top of the visualization. We show that such overlays
              can emphasize and reveal trajectory end-points, branch points and
              associated split-decisions, progression-forming variables (e.g.,
              specific genes), and paths between developmental events in
              cellular state-space. We demonstrate PHATE on single-cell RNA
              sequencing and mass cytometry data pertaining to embryoid body
              differentiation, IPSC reprogramming, and hematopoiesis in the
              bone marrow. We also demonstrate PHATE on non-single cell data

              new ways of studying cellular differentiation. The originally
              proposed framework obtains velocities as the deviation of the
              observed ratio of spliced and unspliced mRNA from an inferred
              steady state. Errors in velocity estimates arise if the central
              assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the
              full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are
              violated. With scVelo (), we address these restrictions by
              solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics
              using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA
              velocity to a wide variety of systems comprising transient cell
              states, which are common in development and in response to
              perturbations. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription,
              splicing and degradation, and recover the latent time of the
              underlying cellular processes. This latent time represents the
              cell's internal clock and is based only on its transcriptional
              dynamics. Moreover, scVelo allows us to identify regimes of
              regulatory changes such as stages of cell fate commitment and,
              therein, systematically detects putative driver genes. We
              demonstrate that scVelo enables disentangling heterogeneous

              popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their
              ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations.
              Analysing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own
              statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate
              approaches are based on data normalisation, followed by dimension
              reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the
              case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear
              clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow
              continuous branching lineages. RESULTS: Here we propose the use
              of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining
              differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell
              data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of
              uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the
              establishment of a pseudo-temporal ordering of single cells in a
              high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to
              reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data
              originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from
              a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the
              transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with
              some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the
              robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g.
              measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on
              simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative
              polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data sets (i.e. mouse
              haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an
              RNA-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that
              diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal
              Component Analysis (PCA) and are advantageous over other
              techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as

              Force-directed layouts of k-nearest-neighbor graphs can visualize
              continuous gene expression topologies in a manner that preserves
              high-dimensional relationships and allows manually exploration of

              high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a
              two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of
              Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is
              much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better
              visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together
              in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing
              techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at
              many different scales. This is particularly important for
              high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related,

              tool to discover and define cellular phenotypes. While
              computational scRNA-seq methods are currently well suited for
              experiments representing a single condition, technology, or
              species, analyzing multiple datasets simultaneously raises new
              challenges. In particular, traditional analytical workflows
              struggle to align subpopulations that are present across
              datasets, limiting the possibility for integrated or comparative
              analysis. Here, we introduce a new computational strategy for
              scRNA-seq alignment, utilizing common sources of variation to
              identify shared subpopulations between datasets as part of our R
              toolkit Seurat. We demonstrate our approach by aligning scRNA-seq
              datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions,
              hematopoietic progenitors sequenced across two profiling
              technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human
              and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional
              cell states jointly across datasets, and can identify
              subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets
              independently. We anticipate that these methods will serve not
              only to correct for batch or technology-dependent effects, but
              also to facilitate general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets,
              potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell
              states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.

              transcriptome profiling of 144 single LNCaP prostate cancer cells
              treated or untreated with androgen after cell cycle

              expressed genes identified eight potential subpopulations of
              LNCaP cells, revealing a previously unappreciable level of
              cellular heterogeneity to androgen stimulation. One subpopulation
              displayed stem-like features with a slower cell doubling rate,
              increased sphere formation capability, and resistance to G2/M
              arrest induced by a mitosis inhibitor. Advanced growth of this
              subpopulation was associated with enhanced expression of 10 cell

              SCExV is able to take any data matrix of Ct values as an input,

              In contrast, when challenged through transplantation,

              hematopoiesis and became gradually exhausted upon serial

              large part downstream of PPAR??. Importantly, adenoviral
              knockdown of hepatic FGF21 in KD-fed mice causes fatty liver,
              lipemia, and reduced serum ketones, due at least in part to
              altered expression of key genes governing lipid and ketone
              metabolism. Hence, induction of FGF21 in liver is required for
              the normal activation of hepatic lipid oxidation, triglyceride
              clearance, and ketogenesis induced by KD. These findings identify
              hepatic FGF21 as a critical regulator of lipid homeostasis and
              identify a physiological role for this hepatic hormone. ?? 2007

              studies on the virtual reality (VR) technology for the management
              of pain and anxiety among patients with cancer, and to analyze
              the effectiveness of VR in the reviewed studies. DESIGN: This
              review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items
              for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
              SETTING: Multiple databases from their inception through November
              2018. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed to identify
              studies that evaluated the effectiveness of VR in managing pain
              and anxiety among patients with cancer. The methodological
              quality of included studies was appraised using the modified
              Downs and Black checklist. RESULTS: Thirteen studies published
              between 1999 and 2018 were eligible for inclusion. These included
              studies were classified as being of good or fair quality. The
              consensus across the included studies was that compared with
              standard care, VR plus standard care were more effective in
              reducing pain and anxiety especially in children and adolescent

              technology is effective in controlling symptoms in patients with
              cancer, the results of this review suggested that VR intervention

              patients with cancer. Therefore, clinicians may consider VR

              long-term illnesses, 9 parents, and 21 health care professionals
              to evaluate the mock-up (prototype) of the mHealth tool. Data
              were synthesized using the interpretive description technique.
              RESULTS: A total of 4 aspects of needs emerged from the synthesis
              of the data, as follows: different perspectives on provided and
              perceived support; the need for an easy-to-use, non-clinic-based
              tool to self-report symptoms and to facilitate communication; the
              need for safety by being in control and reaching the child's
              voice; and a way of mapping the illness journey to facilitate
              recall and improve diagnostics. The children with long-term
              illnesses expressed a need to not only communicate about pain but
              also communicate about anxiety, fatigue, fear, and nausea.
              CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicated that the
              PicPecc (Pictorial Support in Person-Centered Care for Children)
              app is a potential solution for providing communicative support
              to children with long-term illnesses dealing with multiple
              symptoms and conditions. The interview data also highlighted
              symptoms that are at risk of being overlooked if they are not
              included in the mobile app. Further studies are needed to include
              usability testing and evaluation in hospitals and home care
              settings.",

               current research, the authors discuss the organisation of
               Swedish doctoral education, the supervisor's professional
               practice, doctoral students' learning, and the quality system of
               this education in Sweden. The connection between theory and
               practice runs throughout the entire book. Using authentic cases
               and examples from different educational environments, it is
               demonstrated how supervision is dependent on both individual and
               cultural factors. In addition, the book offers its readers
               numerous reflection exercises that can help move thinking
               forward, both individually and collegially. The book is aimed
               primarily at supervisors in doctoral education, regardless of
               the discipline within which they are active or their previous
               experience. It can also be useful for doctoral students who are
               interested in understanding their own learning process and who
               would like to know what can be expected of them in their

              EBF1 function in mouse B-cell progenitors results in reduced
              expression of Myc. Ectopic expression of MYC partially rescued
              B-cell expansion in the absence of EBF1 both in vivo and in
              vitro. Using chromosome conformation analysis in combination with
              ATAC-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, and
              reporter gene assays, six EBF1-responsive enhancer elements were
              identified within the Myc locus. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting
              of EBF1-binding sites identified one element of key importance
              for Myc expression and pro-B cell expansion. These data provide
              evidence that Myc is a direct target of EBF1. Furthermore,
              chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis revealed that
              several regulatory elements in the Myc locus are targets of PAX5.
              However, ectopic expression of PAX5 in EBF1-deficient cells
              inhibits the cell cycle and reduces Myc expression, suggesting
              that EBF1 and PAX5 act in an opposing manner to regulate Myc
              levels. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the finding
              that Pax5 inactivation reduces requirements for EBF1 in
              pro-B-cell expansion. The binding of EBF1 and PAX5 to regulatory
              elements in the human MYC gene in a B-cell acute lymphoblastic

              protein of critical importance for lineage specification and
              survival of B-lymphoid progenitors. Here, we report that impaired
              EBF1 function in mouse B-cell progenitors results in reduced
              expression of Myc. Ectopic expression of MYC partially rescued
              B-cell expansion in the absence of EBF1 both in vivo and in
              vitro. Using chromosome conformation analysis in combination with
              ATAC-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, and
              reporter gene assays, six EBF1-responsive enhancer elements were
              identified within the Myc locus. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting
              of EBF1-binding sites identified one element of key importance
              for Myc expression and pro-B cell expansion. These data provide
              evidence that Myc is a direct target of EBF1. Furthermore,
              chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis revealed that
              several regulatory elements in the Myc locus are targets of PAX5.
              However, ectopic expression of PAX5 in EBF1-deficient cells
              inhibits the cell cycle and reduces Myc expression, suggesting
              that EBF1 and PAX5 act in an opposing manner to regulate Myc
              levels. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the finding
              that Pax5 inactivation reduces requirements for EBF1 in
              pro-B-cell expansion. The binding of EBF1 and PAX5 to regulatory
              elements in the human MYC gene in a B-cell acute lymphoblastic
              leukemia cell line indicates that the EBF1:PAX5:MYC regulatory
              loop is conserved and may control both normal and malignant
              B-cell development.",

              quiescent state, its maintenance and regulation is still
              incompletely understood. Schlafen2 (Slfn2) is a cytoplasmic

              of the immune system. Interestingly, Slfn2 is highly expressed in

              of Slfn2 in the regulation of HSC we have studied HSC function in
              the elektra mouse model, where the elektra allele of the Slfn2
              gene contains a point mutation causing loss of function of the

              caused an increased amount of apoptotic stem and progenitor
              cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that
              dysregulation of Slfn2 results in a functional deficiency of

              a drastically impaired ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic
              system following transplantation and an increase in HSC
              proliferation. This study thus identifies Slfn2 as a novel and

              that compromised mRNA translation and ribosomal stress are
              pathogenic mechanisms causing depletion of erythroid precursors.
              To gain further insight to disease mechanisms in DBA, we
              performed a custom short hairpin RNA (shRNA) based screen against
              750 genes hypothesized to affect DBA pathophysiology. Among the
              hits were two shRNAs against the erythroid specific
              heme-regulated eIF2$\alpha$ kinase (HRI), which is a negative

              analysis showed that this modification spans the entire body of

              deletion of the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma protein (pRb)
              causes anemia in mice. Erythroid-specific deletion of pRb has
              been found to result in inefficient erythropoiesis because of
              deregulated coordination of cell cycle exit and mitochondrial
              biogenesis. However, the pathophysiology remains to be fully
              described, and further characterization of the link between cell
              cycle regulation and mitochondrial function is needed. To this
              end we further assessed conditional erythroid-specific deletion
              of pRb. This resulted in macrocytic anemia, despite elevated
              levels of erythropoietin (Epo), and an accumulation of erythroid
              progenitors in the bone marrow, a phenotype strongly resembling
              refractory anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes
              (MDS). Using high-fractionation fluorescence-activated cell
              sorting analysis for improved phenotypic characterization, we
              illustrate that erythroid differentiation was disrupted at the
              orthochromatic stage. Transcriptional profiling of sequential
              purified populations revealed failure to upregulate genes
              critical for mitochondrial function such as Pgc1$\beta$, Alas2,
              and Abcb7 specifically at the block, together with disturbed heme
              production and iron transport. Notably, deregulated ABCB7 causes
              ring sideroblastic anemia in MDS patients, and the mitochondrial
              co-activator PGC1$\beta$ is heterozygously lost in del5q MDS.
              Importantly, the anemia could be rescued through enhanced PPAR
              signaling in vivo via either overexpression of Pgc1$\beta$ or
              bezafibrate administration. In conclusion, lack of pRb results in
              MDS-like anemia with disrupted differentiation and impaired
              mitochondrial function at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage.
              Our findings reveal for the first time a role for pRb in heme and
              iron regulation, and indicate that pRb-induced anemia can be

              puzzled the field since its initial discovery. Here, we explore
              changes in B cell positive selection as a function of
              developmental time by exploiting a link between CD5 surface
              levels and the natural occurrence of self-reactive B cell
              receptors (BCRs) in BCR wild-type mice. We show that the
              heterochronic RNA binding protein Lin28b potentiates a neonatal
              mode of B cell selection characterized by enhanced overall
              positive selection in general and the developmental progression
              of CD5(+) immature B cells in particular. Lin28b achieves this by
              amplifying the CD19/PI3K/c-Myc positive feedback loop, and
              ectopic Lin28b expression restores both positive selection and
              mature B cell numbers in CD19(-/-) adult mice. Thus, the
              temporally restricted expression of Lin28b relaxes the rules for
              B cell selection during ontogeny by modulating tonic signaling.
              We propose that this neonatal mode of B cell selection represents
              a cell-intrinsic cue to accelerate the de novo establishment of

              visualisation which is also accessible and intuitive for use by
              non-bioinformaticians, as well as bioinformaticians. RESULTS: We
              present the Single cell expression visualiser (SCExV), a webtool
              developed to expedite the analysis of single cell qRT-PCR data.
              SCExV is able to take any data matrix of Ct values as an input,
              but can handle files exported by the Fluidigm Biomark platform
              directly. In addition, SCExV also accepts and automatically
              integrates cell surface marker intensity values which are

              might be one component of a larger transcription factor network

              Gene expression analysis of mouse models and primary human

              the major causes for mortality and morbidity of allogeneic
              hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).
              Plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain
              disease-related proteins, DNAs and RNAs, and have recently been
              suggested as potential biomarker candidates for transplantation
              complications. However, EV isolation from small plasma volumes in
              clinical biomarker studies using conventional methods is
              challenging. We therefore investigated if EVs isolated by novel
              automated acoustic trapping could be developed as potential
              biomarkers for allo-HSCT complications by performing a clinical
              proof-of-principle study. RESULTS: Plasma samples were collected
              from twenty consecutive patients with high-risk/relapsed
              hematologic malignancies undergoing allo-HSCT before
              transplantation and post-transplant up to 12 weeks. EVs were
              isolated from small plasma sample volumes (150 $\mu$l) by an
              automated, acoustofluidic-based particle trapping device, which
              utilizes a local $\lambda$/2 ultrasonic standing wave in a
              borosilicate glass capillary to capture plasma EVs among
              pre-seeded polystyrene microbeads through sound scatter
              interactions. We found that EVs could be reliably isolated from
              all plasma samples (n = 173) and that EV numbers increased more
              than 2-fold in the majority of patients after transplantation.
              Also, sufficient quantities of RNA for downstream microRNA
              (miRNA) analysis were obtained from all samples and EV miRNA
              profiles were found to differ from whole plasma profiles. As a
              proof of principle, expression of platelet-specific miR-142-3p in
              EVs was shown to correlate with platelet count kinetics after
              transplantation as expected. Importantly, we identified plasma EV
              miRNAs that were consistently positively correlated with
              infection and GvHD, respectively, as well as miRNAs that were
              consistently negatively correlated with these complications.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that acoustic enrichment of
              EVs in a clinical biomarker study setting is feasible and that
              downstream analysis of acoustically-enriched EVs presents a
              promising tool for biomarker development in allo-HSCT. Certainly,
              these findings warrant further exploration in larger studies,
              which will have significant implications not only for biomarker
              studies in transplantation but also for the broad field of

              chromatin modification is thought to silence (H3K27me3) lineage
              control genes while 'poising' (H3K4me3) them for subsequent
              activation during differentiation, implying an important role for
              epigenetic modification in directing cell fate decisions.
              However, rather than representing an equivalently balanced
              epigenetic mark, the patterns and levels of histone modifications
              at bivalent genes can vary widely and the criteria for
              identifying this chromatin signature are poorly defined. RESULTS:
              Here, we initially show how chromatin status alters during
              lineage commitment and differentiation at a single well
              characterised bivalent locus. In addition we have determined how
              chromatin modifications at this locus change with gene expression
              in both ensemble and single cell analyses. We also show, on a
              global scale, how mRNA expression may be reflected in the ratio
              of H3K4me3/H3K27me3. CONCLUSIONS: While truly 'poised' bivalently
              modified genes may exist, the original hypothesis that all
              bivalent genes are epigenetically premarked for subsequent
              expression might be oversimplistic. In fact, from the data
              presented in the present work, it is equally possible that many
              genes that appear to be bivalent in pluripotent and multipotent
              cells may simply be stochastically expressed at low levels in the
              process of multilineage priming. Although both situations could
              be considered to be forms of 'poising', the underlying mechanisms
              and the associated implications are clearly different.",

  author   = "Bochukova, Elena G and Soneji, Shamit and Wall, Steven A and
              Wilkie, Andrew O M",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis can be caused by both genetic and
              environmental factors, the relative contributions of which vary
              between patients. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic
              mutation or chromosomal abnormality in ∼ 21\% of cases, but it is
              likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered.
              OBJECTIVE: To identify a shared signature of genetically
              determined craniosynostosis by comparing the expression patterns
              in three monogenic syndromes with a control group of patients
              with non-syndromic sagittal synostosis. METHODS: Fibroblasts from
              10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution
              S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R),
              Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and
              non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were
              cultured. The relative expression of ∼ 47,000 transcripts was
              quantified on Affymetrix arrays. RESULTS: 435, 45 and 46
              transcripts were identified in the Apert, Muenke and
              Saethre-Chotzen groups, respectively, that differed significantly
              from the controls. Forty-six of these transcripts were shared
              between two or more syndromes and, in all but one instance,
              showed the same direction of altered expression level compared
              with controls. Pathway analysis showed over-representation of the
              shared transcripts in core modules involving cell-to-cell
              communication and signal transduction. Individual samples from
              the Apert syndrome cases could be reliably distinguished from
              non-syndromic samples based on the gene expression profile, but
              this was not possible for samples from patients with Muenke and
              Saethre-Chotzen syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Common modules of altered
              gene expression shared by genetically distinct forms of
              craniosynostosis were identified. Although the expression
              profiles cannot currently be used to classify individual
              patients, this may be overcome by using more sensitive assays and
              sampling additional tissues.",

              myeloid neoplasms and reduced adaptive immune responses. Similar
              phenotypes are observed in mice and have been linked to
              alterations arising at the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) level.
              Such an association is, however, less established in human
              hematopoiesis and prompted us here to detail characteristics of
              the most primitive human hematopoietic compartments throughout
              ontogeny. In addition, we also attempted to interrogate
              similarities between aging human and murine hematopoiesis.
              Coupled to the transition from human cord blood (CB) to young and
              aged bone marrow (BM), we observed a gradual increase in
              frequency of candidate HSCs. This was accompanied by functional
              impairments, including decreased lymphoid output and reduced
              proliferative potential. Downstream of human HSCs, we observed
              decreasing levels of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and
              increasing frequencies of megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors
              (MEPs) with age, which could be linked to changes in
              lineage-affiliated gene expression patterns in aged human HSCs.
              These findings were paralleled in mice. Therefore, our data
              support the notion that age-related changes also in human
              hematopoiesis involve the HSC pool, with a prominent skewing

              terminal differentiation of red blood cells. To gain insight into

              DNA-binding activity. However, one-fifth of TAL1's target
              sequences, mainly among those showing high affinity for TAL1, can

              in the bone marrow has been demonstrated to depend on the

              the limited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this
              study, we aimed at determining whether HIF-1$\alpha$ is involved
              in protecting HSCs from ROS. Results: Oxidative stress was
              induced by DL-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)-treatment, which
              increases the mitochondrial ROS level. Hypoxia rescued
              Lineage-Sca-1(+)c-kit(+) (LSK) cells from BSO-induced apoptosis,
              whereas cells succumbed to apoptosis in normoxia. Apoptosis in
              normoxia was inhibited with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine
              or by overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. Moreover,
              stabilized expression of oxygen-insensitive HIFs could not
              protect LSK cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis at
              normoxia, neither could short hairpin RNA to Hif-1$\alpha$
              inhibit the protective effects by hypoxia in LSK cells. Likewise,
              BSO treatment of LSK cells from Hif-1$\alpha$ knockout mice did
              not suppress the effects seen in hypoxia. Microarray analysis
              identified the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway as a
              pathway induced by hypoxia. By using NF-$\kappa$B lentiviral
              construct and DNA-binding assay, we found increased NF-$\kappa$B
              activity in cells cultured in hypoxia compared with normoxia.
              Using an inhibitor against NF-$\kappa$B activation, we could
              confirm the involvement of NF-$\kappa$B signaling as BSO-mediated
              cell death was significantly increased in hypoxia after adding
              the inhibitor. Innovation: HIF-1$\alpha$ is not involved in
              protecting HSCs and progenitors to elevated levels of ROS on
              glutathione depletion during hypoxic conditions. Conclusion: The

              the molecular and cellular hematopoietic defects are poorly
              understood. To gain insight into this condition, we analyzed gene
              expression profiles of marrow CD34+ progenitor cells from
              normal-karyotype, low-blast-count MDS patients, age-matched
              controls, and patients with non-MDS anemia. Given the
              heterogeneity of early MDS, a surprisingly consistent finding was
              decreased expression of B-cell lineage-affiliated genes in MDS
              patients compared with healthy controls and 3 of 5 samples with
              non-MDS anemia. Both patients with non-MDS anemia with reduced

              from genetically outbred populations, but also because they may
              undergo progressive adaptation upon long-term culture in vitro.
              Such adaptation may reflect selection of variants with altered
              propensity for survival and retention of an undifferentiated
              phenotype. Elucidating the mechanisms involved will be important
              for understanding normal self-renewal and commitment to
              differentiation and for validating the safety of HESC-based
              therapy. We have investigated this process of adaptation at the
              cellular and molecular levels through a comparison of early
              passage (normal) and late passage (adapted) sublines of a single
              HESC line, H7. To account for spontaneous differentiation that
              occurs in HESC cultures, we sorted cells for SSEA3, which marks
              undifferentiated HESC. We show that the gene expression
              programmes of the adapted cells partially reflected their
              aberrant karyotype, but also resulted from a failure in
              X-inactivation, emphasizing the importance in adaptation of
              karyotypically silent epigenetic changes. On the basis of growth
              potential, ability to re-initiate ES cultures and global
              transcription profiles, we propose a cellular differentiation
              hierarchy for maintenance cultures of HESC: normal SSEA3+ cells
              represent pluripotent stem cells. Normal SSEA3- cells have exited
              this compartment, but retain multilineage differentiation
              potential. However, adapted SSEA3+ and SSEA3- cells co-segregate
              within the stem cell territory, implying that adaptation reflects
              an alteration in the balance between self-renewal and
              differentiation. As this balance is also an essential feature of
              cancer, the mechanisms of culture adaptation may mirror those of

              Adherence rate, calculated monthly, was defined as ratio of days
              of MP bottle opening to days when MP was prescribed. RESULTS:
              After 53,394 person-days of monitoring, adherence declined from
              94.7\% (month 1) to 90.2\% (month 6; P < .001). Mean adherence

              P < .001), and patients from single-mother households (80.6\% v
              93.1\%; P = .001). A progressive increase in relapse was observed
              with decreasing adherence (reference: adherence $\geq$ 95\%;
              94.9\% to 90\%: hazard ratio [HR], 4.1; 95\% CI,1.2 to 13.5; P =

              incidence of relapse ($\pm$ standard deviation) was higher among
              Hispanics (16.5\% $\pm$ 4.0\% v 6.3\% $\pm$ 2.2\%; P = .02).

              continued to demonstrate higher relapse, whereas at rates < 90\%,

              familiarity with virtual reality among adolescents, there is
              great potential to use virtual reality to address adolescents'
              unique health care delivery needs while in hospital. While there
              have been reviews on the use of virtual reality for specific
              health conditions and procedures, none to date have reviewed the
              full scope of virtual reality hospital interventions for
              adolescents who are often combined with children as a homogenous
              group, despite the fact that adolescents experience virtual
              environments different from children. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
              review was to systematically identify available evidence
              regarding the use of virtual reality interventions for adolescent
              patients in hospital settings to evaluate effectiveness,
              suitability, and safety and identify opportunities for future
              research. METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, and Scopus
              databases were searched using keywords and phrases. Retrieved
              abstracts (n=1525) were double screened, yielding 276 articles
              for full-text screening. Of these, 8 articles met inclusion
              criteria. Data were extracted to a standardized coding sheet, and
              a narrative synthesis was performed due to the heterogeneity of
              the studies. RESULTS: Four RCTs and 4 single-case reports were
              identified for inclusion, all of which aimed to reduce pain or
              anxiety. The scenarios targeted were burn pain, venipuncture,
              chemotherapy, preoperative anxiety, and palliative care. Three
              out of 4 RCTs found significant reductions in pain or anxiety
              outcomes measures when using virtual reality compared to standard
              care or other distraction techniques; however, only 1 study
              combined self-reported experiences of pain or anxiety with any
              physiological measures. Single-case reports relied primarily upon
              qualitative feedback, with patients reporting reduced pain or
              anxiety and a preference for virtual reality to no virtual
              reality. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality can provide a safe and
              engaging way to reduce pain and anxiety in adolescents while in
              hospital, particularly when virtual reality software is highly
              immersive and specifically designed for therapeutic purposes. As
              VR becomes more accessible and affordable for use in hospitals,

  abstract = "Natural Killer (NK) cells represent the cytotoxic member within
              the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family that are important against
              viral infections and cancer. While the NK cell emergence from
              hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells through multiple
              intermediate stages and the underlying regulatory gene network
              has been extensively studied in mouse, this process is not well
              characterized in human. Here, using a temporal in vitro model to
              reconstruct the developmental trajectory of NK lineage, we
              identified an ILC-restricted oligo-potent Stage 3a
              CD34-CD117+CD161+CD45RA+CD56- progenitor population, that
              exclusively gave rise to CD56-expressing ILCs in vitro. We also
              further investigated a previously non-appreciated heterogeneity
              within the CD56+CD94-NKp44+ subset, phenotypically equivalent to
              Stage 3b population containing both group-1 ILC and RORt+ ILC3
              cells, that could be further separated based on their
              differential expression of DNAM-1 and CD161 receptors. We
              confirmed that DNAM-1hi S3b and CD161hiCD117hi ILC3 populations
              distinctively differed in their expression of effector molecules,
              cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, analysis
              of lineage output using DNA-barcode tracing across these stages
              supported a close developmental relationship between S3b-NK and
              S4 (CD56+CD94+) cells, while distant to ILC3 subset.
              Cross-referencing gene signatures of culture derived NK cells and
              other non-cytotoxic ILCs with publicly available datasets
              validated that these in vitro stages highly resemble
              transcriptional profiles of respective in vivo ILC counterparts.
              Finally, by integrating RNA-velocity and gene-network analysis
              through SCENIC we unravel a network of coordinated and highly
              dynamic regulons driving the cytotoxic NK cell program, as a
              guide map for future studies on NK cell regulation.",

  abstract = "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enable hematopoietic stem cell
              transplantation (HCT) through their ability to replenish the
              entire blood system. Proliferation of HSCs is linked to decreased
              reconstitution potential, and a precise regulation of actively
              dividing HSCs is thus essential to ensure long-term
              functionality. This regulation becomes important in the
              transplantation setting where HSCs undergo proliferation followed
              by a gradual transition to quiescence and homeostasis. Although
              mouse HSCs have been well studied under homeostatic conditions,
              the mechanisms regulating HSC activation under stress remain
              unclear. Here, we analyzed the different phases of regeneration
              after transplantation. We isolated bone marrow from mice at 8
              time points after transplantation and examined the reconstitution
              dynamics and transcriptional profiles of stem and progenitor
              populations. We found that regenerating HSCs initially produced
              rapidly expanding progenitors and displayed distinct changes in
              fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis. Moreover, we observed
              molecular changes in cell cycle, MYC and mTOR signaling in both
              HSCs, and progenitor subsets. We used a decay rate model to fit
              the temporal transcription profiles of regenerating HSCs and
              identified genes with progressively decreased or increased
              expression after transplantation. These genes overlapped to a
              large extent with published gene sets associated with key aspects
              of HSC function, demonstrating the potential of this data set as
              a resource for identification of novel HSC regulators. Taken
              together, our study provides a detailed functional and molecular
              characterization of HSCs at different phases of regeneration and
              identifies a gene set associated with the transition from
              proliferation to quiescence.",
